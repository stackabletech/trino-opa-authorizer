= trino-opa-authorizer

== Usage


=== OPA

Currently expects that Open Policy Agent is listening on http://localhost:8181. Run `opa run --server example.rego` in the repo folder
to test an initial example.

=== Trino plugin

Assuming that you already have a Trino server set up.

1. Run `mvn package`
2. Copy (or symlink) `target/out` to `$TRINO_DIR/plugins/trino-opa-authorizer`
3. Copy (or symlink) `access-control.properties` to `$TRINO_DIR/etc/access-control.properties`
4. Start Trino

=== Tests

The tests assume that OPA is available on your path as `opa`, and can then be executed by running `mvn test`.
